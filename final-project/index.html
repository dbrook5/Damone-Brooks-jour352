</p>
<div class="chapterheadline">Athletes typically train in adverse conditions
</div>
<p>to challenge their minds and bodies, so they are able showcase their athletic gifts during their sporting events. The rigors of the summer heat can be extremely harmful to the health of athletes. Several athletes use their determination to persevere through exorbitant temperatures to improve their physical talents.</p>




<p>However, when athletes exercise in the peak of the summer, there is an increased risk of suffering a heatstroke. A heatstroke is a condition caused by your body overheating, typically a result of a lengthy exposure to or physical exertion in high temperatures.</p>

<p>On May 29, 2018, Randallstown native and University of Maryland offensive lineman Jordan McNair, collapsed during an off-season workout on campus in College Park. </p>


<p>McNair had showed clear indications of extreme exhaustion and struggled to stand upright as he ran a set of 110-yard sprints. He was also found to have a body temperature of 106 degrees at Washington Adventist Hospital in Takoma Park.</p>

<p>McNair was transferred to The R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, where he would ultimately die of a heatstroke on June 13, 2018.</p>

<p>Tonya Wilson, McNair’s mother, believes that college teams will push student-athletes past reasonable limits to secure a win for the university.</p>

<div class="quote">"Winning – that’s it – winning. Push those athletes – push them, push them, push them because at the end of the day it’s all about a win.” Wilson said.</div>

<p>The summer provides millions of athletes with a unique challenge of improving their skills, conditioning, and determination amid difficult circumstances. But it is vital to emphasize the importance of taking rest breaks and proper hydration.</p>

<p>The number of fatalities in football due to heat strokes have consistently fluctuated since 2004. In 2008 and 2011, there were 6 heat stroke fatalities that occurred in each of those respective years.</p>

<div class="urban">Sports in the South</div>

<p>High school sports are revered for showcasing the talent of amateur athletes, faithful fans, and the intensity a Friday night game can bring. There are certain areas within the United States that are increasingly passionate about high school sports juxtaposed to other areas.</p>

<p>Southern states such as N. Carolina, S. Carolina, Georgia, and Florida are famously known for glorifying and following high school sports on a level that cannot be rivaled. </p>

<p>Friday night football games are an event that players, parents, and members of the community look forward to each fall.</p>

<p>Athletes in the south are practicing in humid temperatures, while preparing for the anticipation and excitement of their upcoming games.</p>

<p>In June 2020, the Zachary Martin Act was signed into law and named in honor of a high school player from Riverdale, Tennessee, who died from heatstroke at football practice in 2017. </p>

" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-eawkX" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eawkX/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="526"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

<p>Laurie Giordano, Martin’s mother, will greatly miss the endearing qualities of her son, therefore, she is encouraged to see the legacy her son has left behind.</p>

<p>Giordano strongly believes that water and rest breaks should not be confined to a designated time.</p>

<div class="quote">“Players can get water at any time that they need water, they don’t have to wait until break time.” Giordano said.</div>

<p>While football is a compelling and entertaining sport, the physical demand and energy exerted have led to the tragic deaths of several athletes. </p>

<p>According to LiveWell with UnityPoint Health, there are some valuable tips for athletes to prevent heat injury. </p>

<p>Athletes should start to consume a good number of fluids several hours prior to exercising or training in an outdoor environment.</p>

<p>It is also important to hydrate throughout the duration of your physical activity.</p>


  <p>Sunburn is one of the most common heat-related injuries in athletes training in the outdoors. By applying a sunscreen with a SPF of 30 or higher, athletes are providing their skin with a extra layer of protection from the sun.</p>

  <p>For sports that may implement two-a-day practices, coaches and higher officials should attempt to avoid the hottest time of the day to conduct practices. </p>

  <p>When athletes are dressing for outdoor training, it is recommended to wear light-colored, light-weight clothing that provides sun protection.</p>
